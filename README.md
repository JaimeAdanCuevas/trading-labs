Trading repo

Repository for experimental trading strategies, data analysis, and visualization as part of a mentorship program on trading, AI, and security concepts.

Overview

This repository serves as a practical playground for learning and testing trading strategies while integrating concepts from AI and hacking/technical analysis. It focuses on historical market data analysis, strategy backtesting, and visualization of key indicators, specifically using Simple Moving Averages (SMA).

The main goal is to combine hands-on experimentation with structured learning to develop a deeper understanding of market behavior and algorithmic strategy implementation.
